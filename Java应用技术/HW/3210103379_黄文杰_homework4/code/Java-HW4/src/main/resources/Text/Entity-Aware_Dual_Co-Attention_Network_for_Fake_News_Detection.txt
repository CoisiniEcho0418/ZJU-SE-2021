Title: Entity-Aware Dual Co-Attention Network for Fake News Detection
Authors: Sin-han Yang, Chung-chi Chen, Hen-Hsen Huang, Hsin-Hsi Chen
Abstract: Fake news and misinformation spread rapidly on the Internet. How to identify it and how to interpret the identification results have become important issues. In this paper, we propose a Dual Co-Attention Network (Dual-CAN) for fake news detection, which takes news content, social media replies, and external knowledge into consideration. Our experimental results support that the proposed Dual-CAN outperforms current representative models in two benchmark datasets. We further make in-depth discussions by comparing how models work in both datasets with empirical analysis of attention weights.

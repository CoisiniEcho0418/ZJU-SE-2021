Title: Helping a Friend or Supporting a Cause? Disentangling Active and Passive Cosponsorship in the U.S. Congress
Authors: Giuseppe Russo, Christoph Gote, Laurence Brandenberger, Sophia Schlosser, Frank Schweitzer
Abstract: In the U.S. Congress, legislators can use active and passive cosponsorship to support bills. We show that these two types of cosponsorship are driven by two different motivations: the backing of political colleagues and the backing of the bill’s content. To this end, we develop an Encoder+RGCN based model that learns legislator representations from bill texts and speech transcripts. These representations predict active and passive cosponsorship with an F1-score of 0.88.Applying our representations to predict voting decisions, we show that they are interpretable and generalize to unseen tasks.

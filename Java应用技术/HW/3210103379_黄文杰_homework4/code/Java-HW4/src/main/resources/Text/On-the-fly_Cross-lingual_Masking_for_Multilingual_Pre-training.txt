Title: On-the-fly Cross-lingual Masking for Multilingual Pre-training
Authors: Xi Ai, Bin Fang
Abstract: In multilingual pre-training with the objective of MLM (masked language modeling) on multiple monolingual corpora, multilingual models only learn cross-linguality implicitly from isomorphic spaces formed by overlapping different language spaces due to the lack of explicit cross-lingual forward pass. In this work, we present CLPM (Cross-lingual Prototype Masking), a dynamic and token-wise masking scheme, for multilingual pre-training, using a special token [ùíû]x to replace a random token x in the input sentence. [ùíû]x is a cross-lingual prototype for x and then forms an explicit cross-lingual forward pass. We instantiate CLPM for the multilingual pre-training phase of UNMT (unsupervised neural machine translation), and experiments show that CLPM can consistently improve the performance of UNMT models on {De, Ro, Ne } ‚Üî En. Beyond UNMT or bilingual tasks, we show that CLPM can consistently improve the performance of multilingual models on cross-lingual classification. [ùíû]x x [ùíû]x x {De, Ro, Ne } ‚Üî En
